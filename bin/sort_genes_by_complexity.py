    """
    Reads a list of gene IDs and a complexity file with transcript-level #Paths,
    calculates a weighted score for each gene based on the number of transcripts,
    and writes the gene list sorted by descending score.

    Scoring formula:
        For each gene:
            Let T = number of transcripts for the gene (T > 1 required to score)
            For each transcript i:
                paths_i = #Paths for that transcript
            Score = sum(paths_i Ã— T for all transcripts i)

    Rules:
        - Genes with only 1 transcript are not scored.
        - Genes not present in the complexity file are not scored.
        - All unscored genes appear at the end in the order from genes.txt.

    Args:
        genes_file (str): Path to file containing gene IDs (one per line).
        complexity_file (str): Path to file with transcript complexity info.
        output_file (str): Path to write the sorted gene list.
