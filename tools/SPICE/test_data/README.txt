In each workflow folder you can  find  the
reduced output files and directory systems
of the specific workflows.

Each  folder  also   contains  a  textfile
showing  example  commandline  calls  that
would create the given data.

The  output  is  not entirely complete and 
Spice does not have a test  mode.  If  you
wanna  generate  a small  Library  just to
check  if  it  all  works, you can try the
tetraodon. The species does not have a lot
of  splicing  variants  annotated  and the 
genome is generally small in comparison to
other vertebrates on Ensembl.

If you have any question  you  can  always
reach me via e-Mail:
