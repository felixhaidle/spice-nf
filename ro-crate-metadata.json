            "description": "# BIONF/spice_library_pipeline\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe tool **Splicing-based Protein Isoform Comparison Estimator (SPICE)** was created by Christian Bl\u00fcmel. The original implementation can be found in this repository: https://github.com/chrisbluemel/SPICE.\n\nThis repository contains a Nextflow-based pipeline to automate the creation of SPICE libraries.\nInstead of running multiple scripts manually, you can now use this streamlined pipeline.\n\nIt is roughly divided into the following steps:\n\n* (Down)load transcriptome files\n* Initialize the SPICE library structure\n* Annotate peptide sequences for FAS scoring\n* Reorganize the library structure\n* FAS scoring\n* Merge FAS scores\n\n## Usage\n\nBelow is the general installation/setup/usage explanation. If you are from AK Ebersberger please refer to the AKE usage documentation.\n\n### Install FAS\n\nSPICE heavily relies on **FAS** to function, as the FAS algorithm estimates transcript (dis)similarities.\n\nFAS itself depends on various annotation tools, which cannot be bundled with this pipeline.\nYou must first follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/BIONF/FAS) to set it up.\n\nMake sure the following command runs successfully in the environment where you will execute the pipeline (e.g., when submitting a job via SLURM):\n\n```bash\nfas.doAnno -i test_annofas.fa -o test_output\n```\n\n### Set up the pipeline\nAs this pipeline is not part of nf-core, you first need to clone the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:felixhaidle/spice-nf.git\n```\n\nAfter cloning, you should test the functionality using the test profile.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) for instructions on setting up Nextflow.\n> Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) using `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> This pipeline currently only supports the \"conda\" profile. The environment requirements are defined in `assets/environment.yml`. All processes use the same environment.\n\n```bash\nnextflow run BIONF/spice_library_pipeline \\\n   -profile conda,test \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\n### Run the full pipeline:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run BIONF/spice_library_pipeline \\\n   -profile conda \\\n   --species <SPECIES> \\\n   --release <ENSEMBL_RELEASE_VERSION> \\\n   --anno_tools <PATH_TO_ANNOTOOLS_INSTALLATION> \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\n\n| Parameter         | Description                                                                 |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `-profile conda`  | Specifies the execution profile (only `conda` is supported).                                 |\n| `--species`       | Species name (e.g., `homo_sapiens`, `mus_musculus`). Must match ENSEMBL naming. |\n| `--release`       | ENSEMBL release version (e.g., `109`, `110`). Used to fetch annotation data. |\n| `--anno_tools`    | Path to the installed annotation tools directory (equivalent to the `-t` parameter in `fas.setup`). |\n| `--outdir`        | Output directory for pipeline results. Will be created if it doesn't exist.  |\n\nA full overview of all available parameters can be found in [`parameters.md`](docs/parameters.md).\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or the Nextflow `-params-file` option.\n> Custom config files (via the `-c` option) can be used for configuration **except for parameters**; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\nA full list of available parameters and documentation can also be found in the **Wiki**.\n\n## Credits\n\n`BIONF/spice_library_pipeline` was originally written by **Felix Haidle**.\n\nWe thank the following people for their extensive assistance in the development of this pipeline:\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: If applicable, make list of people who have also contributed -->\n\n## Citations\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Add citation for pipeline after first release. Uncomment lines below and update Zenodo doi and badge at the top of this file. -->\n<!-- If you use BIONF/spice_library_pipeline for your analysis, please cite it using the following doi: [10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX) -->\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Add bibliography of tools and data used in your pipeline -->\n\nAn extensive list of references for the tools used by the pipeline can be found in [`CITATIONS.md`](CITATIONS.md).\n\nThis pipeline uses code and infrastructure developed and maintained by the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) community, reused here under the [MIT license](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n> **The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines.**\n> Philip Ewels, Alexander Peltzer, Sven Fillinger, Harshil Patel, Johannes Alneberg, Andreas Wilm, Maxime Ulysse Garcia, Paolo Di Tommaso & Sven Nahnsen.\n> _Nat Biotechnol._ 2020 Feb 13. doi: [10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x).\n",
